random inspections of vehicles and potentially  depending on the airport  some limitations of indegrees and egress into the airport there will be additional random inspections of vehicles and potentially  depending on the airport  some limitations of indegrees and egress into the airport as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq  there will be retaliatory terror strikes  either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country we see baghdad  a capitol under siege it gives you a sense of  perhaps what 50 years of tension and war will do to your mentality president bush  when he talked earlier to reporters  mentioned that this effort is an effort  this war is an effort to make the homeland  our homeland  more secure we heard from secretary rumsfeld who briefed us on the early stages of the war so even at the very early stages of a defining moment of bush presidency  the president trying to make the case his eyes and especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of the united states as the early prosecution of the war continues in this coalition  it ips the united states doing the overwhelming load of the fighting as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq  there will be retaliatory terror strikes  either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country the national security advisor fanning out  we're told in phone calls to more than three dozen world leaders offering them an update on what is going on that is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the persian gulf war  but there is a significant difference  of course in the last gulf war  you had arab forces on the ground while we do  we want to tell you marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of nasiriyah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary groups today if you are going to fight on the ground  you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way this is one technique  one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge  a bridge that might be defended by iraqis this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing artillery behind them firing back makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces fire ing at you from being able to see this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing for some perspective  let's turn to miles o'brien with retired air force general don shepperd again  today  there were disturbing hints  and we underscore hints here  that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons the findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching baghdad since  as the iraqis should know  u.s. and british forces do not use chemical weapons u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it there has been intelligence scraps  who knows how accurate they are  chatter in the system  that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be planning to use chemical weapons u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counterproductive to saddam  because it would only galvanize international experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have  hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down for some americans who find themselves spending hours on end watching television coverage of the war  it can be hard to break away that is especially true if you have a loved one in the war zone more than 70 percent of americans say they are sad about the war air travel has fallen 10 mers since the war began and some hotel chains say cancellations are up 60 percent of the people say they're watching the war maybe fewer are flying because they worry about terrorism or they worry about what the war will do to the economy or maybe it's everything if there's any kind of terrorism that happens here  i think that would definitely put a damper on everything maybe fewer are flying because they worry about terrorism or they worry about what the war will do to the economy or maybe it's everything tense of thousands of additional u.s. troops are getting ready to join coalition forces fighting the war in iraq the

past two weeks with back-to-back deaths making a total of at least seven journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half years friday night in the gaza strip and a journalist is about to lose his life shortly after several shots are heard an israeli bulldozer can be seen uncovering the israelis say  a tunnel used to smuggle weapons after the journalists shout  another gunshot moments later  another shot and the sound of someone in pain 34-year-old british journalist james miller died on the scene after israeli soldiers come to his aid  the israeli defense sources says miller becomes the second journalist in just two weeks to be killed covering the israeli-palestinian conflict with palestinian cameramen  shot and killed by an israeli soldier on the west bank in mid-april james was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting the israeli government said its forces were returning fire and that miller was shot in the back  suggesting he could have been hit by palestinian gunmen the israeli government said its forces were returning fire and that miller was shot in the back  suggesting he could have been hit by palestinian gunmen with palestinian cameramen  shot and killed by an israeli soldier on the west bank in mid-april those close to miller believe he was shot by an armored israeli personnel carrier whether or not he was shot by israelis gunfire  we are not certain at this time the israeli government said its forces were returning fire and that miller was shot in the back  suggesting he could have been hit by palestinian gunmen we know the israelis fired with back-to-back deaths making a total of at least seven journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half years the message from the israeli government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists  but that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire exchange between israeli forces and palestinian gunmen have a responsibility to take greater precautions the message from the israeli government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists  but that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire

minister might need a job right now reporter: if he doesn't claim his royalty  they'll donate them to an iraqi children's charity are they trying to swim to shore we'll what's believed to be the terror cell responsible for 9/11 major fighting may be over  but many american service men and women injured in iraq are just beginning the very long process of recovery the story of how he got to washington  d.c.  is compelling for several reasons  starting with how close he came to not being here at all i was definitely blessed that i'm not paralyzed or dead i was definitely blessed that i'm not paralyzed or dead 24 hours before the fall of baghdad  24 hours before his fellow marines engaged in a fierce firefight at baghdad university  teeterman's orders had him just south of the capital taking out iraqi resistance a top a warehouse roof 24 hours before the fall of baghdad  24 hours before his fellow marines engaged in a fierce firefight at baghdad university  teeterman's orders had him just south of the capital taking out iraqi resistance a top a warehouse roof there were small pockets of resistance in the area  two  three man groups who had ak-47s and possible rpgs and what not and our job was to just observe forward and make sure no one was waiting to ambush the avs or the tanks and i was on a metal roof and i stepped across the globe  spain and america will continue as strong allys in the war against terror i also offer my condolences to the family and friends of the two members of the spanish media who lost their lives while covering the hostilities i want to thank the president for spain's diplomatic support before the conflict and for the use of spanish air space and bases as the war grew closer i also offer my condolences to the family and friends of the two members of the spanish media who lost their lives while covering the hostilities your journey  particularly to southern iraq  what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime i wasn't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war  the push for war  the drive for war  all that propaganda  was essentially nonsensical because in 1990  saddam hussein made the only self criticism i wasn't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war

1990  saddam hussein made the only self criticism he said  i could either invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen-year's war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in '91 when it could have been finished taken the risk of supporting a shiite insurrection at that point they use the gunships to kill  we think  not less than 50 000 inhabitants of southern iraq and trying to do that to the kurds  as well  so it was a knife edge who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights the little town i was in this southern iraq  as far as i got  i can't boast of further  is where the talks took place we have the transcript of the meeting when they made the decision not to move toward bagdad with bad information who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights maybe before the weapon and then later he said  oh  i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded the slogan makes for a powerful bumper sticker -- guns don't kill people  people do a better one might be  people do and people die and still other people search their souls and struggle for redemption a better one might be  people do and people die and still other people search their souls and struggle for redemption the slogan makes for a

on an israeli army outpost in gaza hamas and other palestinian militant group rejected abbas' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an israeli army outpost in gaza we are all saying that the

end to terrorism  if you want an end to violence  you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process i think that hamas is ready to join the political process  however  if the only price for the political price is you must fight hamas  if that's what they are requiring abu mazen to do  they are almost mandating that he will fail he is not telling them to disband and regulate their weapons  so i have no faith in the ability of abu mazen to put terror aside israel and the united states say arafat has not been tough enough on terrorism  and have

the red planet the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the red planet one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon well  first of all  the spacecraft would not be launched from earth so what's the difficulty in being able to go to mars then if we stay there for about a year or two  the whole trip could last about three years the bigger issue is once we get there  we can't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years  so we're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet looks like it will be some time before we make our way to mars the communications conditions once you're on mars  just to talk to people on earth  there's a 20 minute delay in the conversation you'd have to launch is from in space already  which means we would have to build it in space then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth's orbit all the way to mars he got married my focus is on re-electing president bush and dick cheney next year  the convention is going to be here in the city
